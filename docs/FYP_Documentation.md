# EduGuide AI - Final Year Project Documentation

## Abstract

EduGuide AI is an intelligent education assistant that leverages multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT-4 and Google Gemini) to enhance student learning through automated content generation, interactive question-answering, and personalized study materials. This project addresses the growing need for AI-powered educational tools that can adapt to individual learning styles and provide instant feedback.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Traditional study methods often lack personalization and immediate feedback. Students struggle with:
- Creating effective practice questions from study materials
- Getting instant feedback on their understanding
- Generating comprehensive summaries from lengthy documents
- Accessing interactive learning tools 24/7

### 1.2 Research Objectives
1. Develop an AI-powered platform that generates personalized learning content
2. Implement multi-modal AI integration for enhanced content processing
3. Create an intuitive interface supporting both students and educators
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated content vs traditional methods

### 1.3 Research Questions
- How effectively can AI models generate relevant educational content from user documents?
- What is the impact of instant AI feedback on student learning outcomes?
- How does role-based access (student/teacher) enhance the educational experience?

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 AI in Education
- Adaptive learning systems (VanLehn, 2011)
- Intelligent tutoring systems (Koedinger & Corbett, 2006)
- Natural language processing in education (Dascalu et al., 2013)

### 2.2 Content Generation Technologies
- GPT models in educational contexts (Kasneci et al., 2023)
- Document understanding and summarization (Liu & Lapata, 2019)
- Question generation from text (Du et al., 2017)

### 2.3 Gap Analysis
Current systems lack:
- Multi-AI model integration
- Real-time document chat capabilities
- Comprehensive role-based learning environments

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Design Approach

  openai: new OpenAIService(),
  gemini: new GeminiService(),
  fallback: new FallbackService()
};
```

### 5.2 Key Features Implemented
1. **Document Processing**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX support
2. **Content Generation**: Questions, summaries, key points
3. **Interactive Chat**: PDF document Q&A
4. **Progress Tracking**: Learning analytics
5. **Role Management**: Student/Teacher differentiation
